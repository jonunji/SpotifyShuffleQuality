A tool to give you insights on the randomness of the Spotify shuffle!
## This tool is a WIP!

Some of the features are listed below:
* Automatic shuffling
* Frequency of each song
* Separated by different contexts (album, playlists, artist, etc.)
* Genre and artist data
* Ability to compare different shuffles side by side
* Exporting collected data
* Visualization and analysis of patterns across shuffles
