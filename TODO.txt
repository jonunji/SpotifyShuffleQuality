Each person can pick a playlist
Shuffles like 100 times

For each song:
- Each song ordered by how many times it came up
- People can click on a song to see more info
	- How many times a specific arist came up
	- How many times that album came up
	- Whatever else
	- genre?

Should be easy to use

Smart vs normal vs dumb
- Show them all side by side
- Show commonalities between them all


Remove the forced repeat thing. should detect when a song changes and handle it appropriatly.
- in the queue function
	- first thing is just checking if the current song is the same as the previous
	- if not, just reupdate everything.

when hitting reset while playing, it doesnt actually reset the data
- probably because its midway through that queue_data func, so it still has the existsing data,
- need to exit early, or wait till it's done to reset the data

need to divide things by playing/album and also have some master list.
